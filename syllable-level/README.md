# Syllable Level Models for Agglutinative Languages

This folder is dedicated for the syllable-level solutions for agglutinative language models.

## Things to Experiment with

### Syllable Embeddings

The number of syllables for a syllable level model is so high that inputting plain class vectors is unfeasible.

#### Word2Vec â€“ Syllable2Vec?

With decent preprocessing, it might be possible to extend the Word2Vec methodology to syllables. This would provide a nice way to 

Some potential problems to tackle include what to do with the most common syllables, as well as how to address word borders and linebreaks.

### Syllable Set Size


### RNN chain length

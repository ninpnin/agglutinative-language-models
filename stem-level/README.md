# Stem Level Models for Agglutinative Languages

This folder is dedicated for the stem-level solutions for agglutinative language models.

As in the syllable and word level counterparts, the primary goal of this module is to implement decent text generation.

## Why go with stem level?

The pros in comparison with _syllable_ and _word_ level models include

* __Mimicking of analytic languages:__ the stem level splits words into the stem and the inflection suffix. This largely resembles the structure of an analytic language: it's basically a bunch of uninflectable words and postpositions. As a consequence, models that work well with analytic languages should work well with stem level data as well. And due to English being the current _lingua franca_, these are plentiful.

* __Word2Vec (probably) works like a charm__: due to the analytic-like structure, stem level is bound to yield a great _word2vec_ embedding, probably an even better one than at word level. Experiments can be done with taking out inflections, word separators and/or punctuation.

Cons:

* __Complex preprocessing:__ A stem is not well defined for arbitrary datasets. It's not sure whether exception cases are rare enough not to screw up everything. Moreover, a plethora of options for heuristics are possible, which complicates the experimentation process. Linguistic knowledge is also relatively useless if dataset/vocabulary invariance is the objective.


## Approach

### Embedding 

## Things to Experiment with

### Syllable Embeddings

The number of syllables for a syllable level model is so high that inputting plain class vectors is unfeasible. Therefore, the binary class vectors of syllables have to be embedded into a subspace.


#### Word2Vec â€“ Syllable2Vec?

With decent preprocessing, it might be possible to extend the Word2Vec methodology to syllables. This would provide a nice way to 

Some potential problems to tackle include what to do with the most common syllables, as well as how to address word borders and linebreaks.
